          Every great story begins with curiosity. Mine started with a spark for
          technology that soon grew into a quest to create meaningful digital
          experiences. What began as experimenting with code has now evolved
          into building cross-platform applications, designing scalable systems,
          and exploring how technology can shape the way we live and connect.

        <p>
          I&apos;m currently pursuing my B.Tech in Information Technology from
          Ludhiana, Punjab, and along the way, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience
          through internships and projects using Flutter, React Native, Next.js,
          Firebase, and databases. Each project has been more than just lines of
          code â€” itâ€™s been about solving real problems, working in teams, and
          even coordinating large-scale college events where I learned how
          vision, collaboration, and persistence can turn ideas into reality.
        </p>

        <p>
          For me, technology isnâ€™t just a career â€” it&apos;s the next chapter of a
          story Iâ€™m still writing, often across multiple projects at once.
